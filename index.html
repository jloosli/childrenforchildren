concerts The proceeds from these concerts go to a charity chosen by the kids to benefit children in need. Due to
COVID-19, we are doing things differently by creating a virtual benefit concert containing performances from all
around the world. Even through our challenges, we are uniting to bring more good into the world. This is Children
for Children.</p></div></section><section id=performers><div class=wrapper><h2>Performances</h2><div class=search-wrapper><input type=search class=fuzzy-search placeholder="Search for performers here"></div><section class="cards list"></section></div></section><div id=overlay onclick=closeVideo()></div><section id=our-cause><div class=wrapper><div><h1>About Charity: Water</h1><div class="img-right img-constrained"><img src=/images/water_flowing_through_hands.png alt="Water Flowing Through Hands"></div><p>This year, the proceeds from our online concert will go to <a href=https://www.charitywater.org/ target=_blank>Charity: Water</a>,
which is an organization that supplies water to people in developing countries. Charity Water works with local
experts and people in the community to find the best, most sustainable water sources that will last for a long
time. Each community that Charity Water serves is unique, so the solution to their water shortage is unique as
well, from harvesting rainwater, to installing clean pipes from a local water source. For more information about
Charity water and its mission, visit their website.</p><h2>Why Water?</h2><p>This year, us Children for Children committee members chose Charity Water, because water is a resource that is
essential to a healthy, happy life. Almost 1 in 10 people worldwide do not have access to clean water, which can
have a huge effect on one's health and education. According to Charity Water, "diseases from dirty water kill
more
people every year than all forms of violence, including war", meaning that clean water sources are desperately
needed to prevent death and disease in developing countries.</p><div class="img-left img-constrained"><img src=/images/child_with_water_jug.png alt="Child With Water Jug"></div><p>Along with the sickness and fatality that unsafe water can cause, not having a close water source can affect
communities in education and wellbeing. In developing countries, the walk to a clean water source can sometimes
take hours. According to Charity Water, people spend 40 billion hours a year collecting water in Africa alone.
The
task of getting water normally falls to women and children in the family, and defeats the possibility of
education
for them. Access to a nearby, clean water source can free up more time for families, making food, sanitatoin,
and
education more attainable.</p></div><div class="youtube-wrapper charity-video"><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCHhwxvQqxg frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></section><section id=donation><div class=wrapper><h1>Donate To Our Cause</h1><div class=gfm-embed data-url=https://www.gofundme.com/f/tigrayan-WAR-Victims/widget/large/></div><script defer src=https://www.gofundme.com/static/js/embed.js></script></div></section><script src=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/list.js/2.3.0/list.min.js></script><script src=https://childrenconcert.com/js/index.js></script></body></html>
