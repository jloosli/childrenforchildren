## Here's how the concert works

Children share their talents (I use the word "talent" liberally - we've had everything
from poetry recitations to dances to piano pieces to songs sung to chime-playing to holding up a painting they've done)
and grown-ups come to watch (virtually this year), "paying" the kids for the concert by donating an amount of their choice.
