      <p>This year, the proceeds from our online concert will go to <a href="https://www.charitywater.org/"
                                                                       target="_blank">Charity: Water</a>,
        which is an organization that supplies water to people in developing countries. Charity Water works with local
        experts and people in the community to find the best, most sustainable water sources that will last for a long
        time. Each community that Charity Water serves is unique, so the solution to their water shortage is unique as
        well, from harvesting rainwater, to installing clean pipes from a local water source. For more information about
        Charity water and its mission, visit their website.

      <h2> Why Water?</h2>
      <p>This year, us Children for Children committee members chose Charity Water, because water is a resource that is
        essential to a healthy, happy life. Almost 1 in 10 people worldwide do not have access to clean water, which can
        have a huge effect on one's health and education. According to Charity Water, "diseases from dirty water kill
        more
        people every year than all forms of violence, including war", meaning that clean water sources are desperately
        needed to prevent death and disease in developing countries.</p>

      <p>Along with the sickness and fatality that unsafe water can cause, not having a close water source can affect
        communities in education and wellbeing. In developing countries, the walk to a clean water source can sometimes
        take hours. According to Charity Water, people spend 40 billion hours a year collecting water in Africa alone.
        The
        task of getting water normally falls to women and children in the family, and defeats the possibility of
        education
        for them. Access to a nearby, clean water source can free up more time for families, making food, sanitatoin,
        and
        education more attainable.
